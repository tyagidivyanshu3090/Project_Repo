# Project_Repo @Hitesh_node

- Initialising the project with `npm init -y`
- Installing 1st dependencies `@types/node` which is for suggestion
  - `@types/node`: does not contain any actual functional code. You can't run it. Instead, it contains Type Definitions (basically huge files describing the structure) for everything built into Node.js.
